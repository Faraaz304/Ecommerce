# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature completes the Order microservice implementation to work seamlessly with the existing Customer and Product microservices in a distributed e-commerce system. The order service needs to validate customers, check product availability, handle inventory updates, implement proper error handling, and provide comprehensive order management functionality that matches the reference architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to create orders with multiple products, so that I can purchase items from the e-commerce platform

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer creates an order THEN the system SHALL validate the customer exists in the customer microservice
2. WHEN a customer creates an order THEN the system SHALL validate all products exist in the product microservice and have sufficient inventory
3. WHEN an order is created successfully THEN the system SHALL update product inventory through the product microservice
4. WHEN an order is created THEN the system SHALL assign a unique order reference number
5. WHEN an order is created THEN the system SHALL calculate and store the total amount
6. IF customer validation fails THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with appropriate error message
7. IF product validation fails THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with product-specific error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and validation, so that the system provides clear feedback and maintains data integrity

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with field-level validation details
2. WHEN external service calls fail THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts and connection errors gracefully
3. WHEN business rules are violated THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes with descriptive messages
4. WHEN exceptions occur THEN the system SHALL log errors appropriately without exposing sensitive information
5. IF a customer ID is invalid format THEN the system SHALL return a validation error before making external calls
6. IF product quantities are negative or zero THEN the system SHALL reject the order with a validation error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to retrieve my order information, so that I can track my purchases and order history

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer requests an order by ID THEN the system SHALL return complete order details including customer and product information
2. WHEN a customer requests all their orders THEN the system SHALL return a list of orders with pagination support
3. WHEN requesting orders by customer ID THEN the system SHALL return only orders belonging to that customer
4. IF an order ID doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return 404 Not Found
5. WHEN order details are returned THEN the system SHALL include enriched product information from the product service
6. WHEN order details are returned THEN the system SHALL include customer information from the customer service

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper service communication, so that the order service can interact reliably with customer and product services

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the order service needs customer data THEN it SHALL use HTTP client to communicate with the customer service
2. WHEN the order service needs product data THEN it SHALL use HTTP client to communicate with the product service
3. WHEN making external service calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper timeout and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error responses
5. IF network errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes
6. WHEN calling product purchase endpoint THEN the system SHALL handle inventory updates atomically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive order management, so that I can monitor and manage the order lifecycle

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN orders are created THEN the system SHALL support different order statuses (PENDING, CONFIRMED, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED)
2. WHEN order status changes THEN the system SHALL validate status transitions are valid
3. WHEN retrieving orders THEN the system SHALL support filtering by status, customer, and date ranges
4. WHEN orders are cancelled THEN the system SHALL handle inventory restoration through the product service
5. IF invalid status transitions are attempted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate validation errors
6. WHEN order history is requested THEN the system SHALL return orders sorted by creation date

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper data models and DTOs, so that the API contracts are clear and maintainable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields are present
2. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL include all necessary order information
3. WHEN data is persisted THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity
4. WHEN DTOs are used THEN the system SHALL properly map between entities and DTOs
5. IF required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL return field-specific validation errors
6. WHEN order lines are processed THEN the system SHALL validate product IDs and quantities are valid
